<h1> Project 1 Vector Graphics</h1>
  <p>I started by thinking about what represented Portland to me and what I associated with the subject of the design(planetarium).<br>
    Planetarium, to me, represents outer space, and I knew I wanted to have a multifaceted design to reflect branding for the planetarium <br>
    while maintaining a reference to its location, portland. I also had to come up with the type of image I knew I wanted to create. <br>
    Initial drafts looked childish and rough. I didn't like the effect of drawing my shapes freehand, so I figured out I needed to combine <br>
    and edit the ones that were provided through the program. I knew I wanted something readable, and I liked the idea of negative space <br>
    creating the illusion of a suggested object, in this case, the lighthouse. I did not go directly to Adobe; I stuck to my known medium,<br>
    pen and paper. After coming up with some concepts on paper, I was ready to play around with the program and attempted to turn my idea into art.
    I am satisfied with my logo design, I think I applied the elements of design in a way that was cohesive and creative. My biggest critique of my work <br>
    is that I got too attached to my lighthouse design and lost sight of incorporating elements of the planetarium. I worry that the logo is not <br>
    immediately recognizable as advertising the planetarium, but the same could be said of multiple of the designs I saw during the critique. <br>
    I didn’t realize this assignment was due until after the discussion board had closed, so unfortunately, I do not have my critiques on hand. <br>
    They were generally positive; classmates mentioned that the thought behind my design was evident and I was successful in the execution. <br>
    They said it looked professional and that the planetary elements I included did suggest the planetarium, but it wasn't the focal point of the design.<br>
    I’m happy with the choices I made, especially the inclusion of the constellation Ursa Major in the Celestial sphere. I learned about the technical <br>
    aspects of Adobe, gained a lot of confidence in building and combining shapes, and understood basic tools and how to create color groupings. <br>
    For future assignments, I want to give myself time to explore multiple options and develop multiple ideas, so I have a choice in what worked best <br>
    and ensure I am turning in my best work.
