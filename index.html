<h1> Project 1: Vector Graphics</h1>
  <p>I want my logo to combine iconic Portland imagery with classic cosmic associations. I hope to inspire
fond memories for local mainers and make positive connections for Portlanders between two
quintessential city landmarks. Portland is famous for its beautiful coastline and picturesque
lighthouses, the one I want to represent is Portland Headlight. The planetarium is popular for
education and entertainment, allowing viewers to travel through space in a way that's not possible by
just looking up at the night sky.
To evoke feelings of both sea and sky in viewers, I want to use a limited color palette, mostly blues and
with diluted purple and silver hues. I imagine bold lines and a symmetrical composition, with the
lighthouse aligned in the middle of the design. A light shining towards the sky will end in a dome full
of stars and planets. This will mirror waves lapping at the base of the lighthouse.
I was not inspired by anything in particular. I avoided looking for anything specic before coming up
with an original idea. People will interact with my piece primarily through visual engagement. My
design asks viewers to reminisce and remember the last time they looked up at the stars, feel gratitude
for their environment, and hopefully inspire them to visit the planetarium. It still needs work but I'm
excited to develop it further and see where it will go

<p>I started by thinking about what represented Portland to me and what I associated with the subject of the design(planetarium). Planetarium, to me, represents outer space, and I knew I wanted to have a multifaceted design to reflect branding for the planetarium while maintaining a reference to its location, portland. I also had to come up with the type of image I knew I wanted to create. Initial drafts looked childish and rough. I didn't like the effect of drawing my shapes freehand, so I figured out I needed to combine and edit the ones that were provided through the program. I knew I wanted something readable, and I liked the idea of negative space creating the illusion of a suggested object, in this case, the lighthouse. I did not go directly to Adobe; I stuck to my known medium, pen and paper. After coming up with some concepts on paper, I was ready to play around with the program and attempted to turn my idea into art. 
</p>
</p>I am satisfied with my logo design, I think I applied the elements of design in a way that was cohesive and creative. My biggest critique of my work is that I got too attached to my lighthouse design and lost sight of incorporating elements of the planetarium. I worry that the logo is not immediately recognizable as advertising the planetarium, but the same could be said of multiple of the designs I saw during the critique. I didn’t realize this assignment was due until after the discussion board had closed, so unfortunately, I do not have my critiques on hand. They were generally positive; classmates mentioned that the thought behind my design was evident and I was successful in the execution. They said it looked professional and that the planetary elements I included did suggest the planetarium, but it wasn't the focal point of the design. I’m happy with the choices I made, especially the inclusion of the constellation Ursa Major in the Celestial sphere. I learned about the technical aspects of Adobe, gained a lot of confidence in building and combining shapes, and understood basic tools and how to create color groupings. For future assignments, I want to give myself time to explore multiple options and develop multiple ideas, so I have a choice in what worked best and ensure I am turning in my best work.

<h1> Project 2: Photo Editing</h1>

<p>For my project, I wanted to create a reversal of roles where humans are not at the top of the food chain. I was initially inspired by George Orwell’s Animal Farm. My hope was to create commentary on themes of exploitation, empathy, and perspective. In my first collage, the visual of the mother and daughter pig observing businessman behind bars suggests this reversal of roles where pigs are the dominant species and humans are reduced to ‘animals’. The symbolizes how we often dehumanize and objectify animals seeing them as lesser beings valuable only for consumption without considering their own intelligence and value beyond our means. The pigs in power, observing the businessmen in a vulnerable state, highlights the hypocrisy of how society prioritizes certain forms of intelligence or behavior (like profit-driven capitalism) while ignoring the ethical implications of exploiting animals, who have their own forms of intelligence and complexity. as humans, we see ourselves as superior, often overlooking the capabilities and inherent worth of other species. I wanted to turn the tables and encourage reflection on how we treat animals and the world around us. It also challenges viewers to expand our definitions of intelligence, empathy, and power beyond the human-centric perspective.</p>

<p> In my second collage, three pigs joyfully drive through an idyllic landscape, contrasting the dark undertones of the image. They happily feast on human body parts, like a hand-burger and a tongue ice cream cone. The imagery of pigs acting in this way is obviously an inversion of the typical roles. It is ironic, as now the pigs are the ones consuming humans. I wanted to encourage viewers to think about how we consume animals without deeper thought and the absurdity of power structures in place. The pig's carefree nature suggests that those in positions of power often remain oblivious to the harm they perpetuate. They are happy to enjoy their ride through life, unaffected by the ethics of what they are doing. The inclusion of the liscence plate reading ‘bad girl’ was an attempt to bring some humor to the image while also noting that the ones in power typically know they are being ‘bad’ but are happy to enjoy the benefits. </p>

<h1> Project 3: Moving Image</h1>
  <p>Humans have evolved at a rapid pace over the past few millennia. We’re constantly bombarded with information—from the state of the economy and politics to the pressures of social media and global crises. We're tasked with navigating milestones like marriage, homeownership, travel, saving endangered species, dedicating ourselves to philanthropy, saving the arts, and grappling with the existential question of whether to have children in a world on fire that feels increasingly unstable. The amount of information we are processing is at an all time high. Also considering the constant demand to engage with hundreds of people, ideas, and issues every day, it’s easy to see how overwhelming life has become. Our quick advancement leaves us faced with unprecedented challenges we are all learning to cope with. I think this pace is taking a significant toll on our mental and emotional well-being. We are so far removed from our ancestors, increasingly disconnected from the simpler, slower rhythms of life that once ruled our days. The relentless speed of modern existence brings measurable consequences for our society—mental burnout, a sense of isolation, and a diminished capacity for reflection.</p>
<p>To my viewers I pose the question: What happens when we slow down? When we step away from the noise, simplify our lives, and reintroduce space for meaningful connection and contemplation? What might we discover about ourselves, our world, and our true purpose when we take a breath and allow ourselves to exist at a more deliberate pace? 
</p>
</p>My plan was to split my media project into distinct sections, overlapping videos to be visually overwhelming, with repetition speed, and cutting the video. I wanted to contrast visuals between dark and light, to further highlight the energy of the two extremes I want to represent. I had a vision of taking a few clips, building action, splitting them up, and reordering them to build suspense. So the slow part one after another, then the buildup, then the conclusion, but alternating between the multiple scenes, and I think I achieved this. Visuals I initially considered focus on pleasure in small things, as said before, children playing, reading books, animals stretching/yawning, river flowing, light shining through trees, brushing hair, eating good food, dancing, clouds moving slowly across a sky. I want to create a contrast with scenes of industrialism, big cities, crowds, and stressful big picture things, reminding the viewer to enjoy life as it comes and not get overwhelmed with the big picture. I ended up spending more hours than I thought on this project and am very satisfied with the outcome. It was a fun challenge, and I mean that wholeheartedly.

<h1> Project 4: 3D Model</h1>
  <p> For the 3D modeling assignment I decided to build my breakfast. Most every morning I enjoy a fried egg. Simple, delicous, and reliable. This project took me through many ups and downs, and I honestly haven't enjoyed an egg since, maybe this is the end of an era. It was very satisfying to complete this project as at times I felt I never would. I'm very greatful to my boyfriend who had some background knowledge in blender who I could not have acheived this without. It was a great excersize to anaylize such a simple object so intensively and bring it to life digitally. Since such a big part of this assignment was considering the chosen objects tacticality I found myself thinking a lot about how it really feels to eat an egg, the tastes and textures and I may have given myself a slight egg aversion. I'm taking a break but still appreciate them. I began to see them as very beautiful and more complex than I had ever imagined. I found the encounter to be a multi-sensory experience filled with a plethora of textures tempertures and flavors unfolding from conception to final bite. The cool solidness of a simple plate, Its planes expanding providing a perfect surface. Cold to the touch the porcelain reflects the light around the enjoyer setting the atmostphere for the journey. The egg whites glisten, crinkling at the edges where the butter has crisped them into golden brown lace. The yolk sits proud in the eggs center a glossy yellow dome trembling slightly as the plate is moved or a fork pierces the body. Theres a soft resistance as the fork slices through the egg, the warm delicte balloon of the velvety yolk filling ones mouth with the rich warm sap. The egg white contrasts the explosion, there is more structure, tender in the middle but crackling at the crispy edges. Like snowflakes, you will never eat the same egg twice and I was under prepared for the journey this project would take me on with a food I consume often but do not consider.
