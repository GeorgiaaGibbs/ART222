<p style="background-color:aquamarine;"> I want my logo to combine iconic Portland imagery with classic cosmic associations. I hope to inspire
fond memories for local mainers and make positive connections for Portlanders between two
quintessential city landmarks. Portland is famous for its beautiful coastline and picturesque
lighthouses, the one I want to represent is Portland Headlight. The planetarium is popular for
education and entertainment, allowing viewers to travel through space in a way that's not possible by
just looking up at the night sky.
To evoke feelings of both sea and sky in viewers, I want to use a limited color palette, mostly blues and
with diluted purple and silver hues. I imagine bold lines and a symmetrical composition, with the
lighthouse aligned in the middle of the design. A light shining towards the sky will end in a dome full
of stars and planets. This will mirror waves lapping at the base of the lighthouse.
I was not inspired by anything in particular. I avoided looking for anything specic before coming up
with an original idea. People will interact with my piece primarily through visual engagement. My
design asks viewers to reminisce and remember the last time they looked up at the stars, feel gratitude
for their environment, and hopefully inspire them to visit the planetarium. It still needs work but I'm
excited to develop it further and see where it will go.

<h1> Project 1 Vector Graphics</h1>
  <p>I started by thinking about what represented Portland to me and what I associated with the subject of the design(planetarium). Planetarium, to me, represents outer space, and I knew I wanted to have a multifaceted design to reflect branding for the planetarium while maintaining a reference to its location, portland. I also had to come up with the type of image I knew I wanted to create. Initial drafts looked childish and rough. I didn't like the effect of drawing my shapes freehand, so I figured out I needed to combine and edit the ones that were provided through the program. I knew I wanted something readable, and I liked the idea of negative space creating the illusion of a suggested object, in this case, the lighthouse. I did not go directly to Adobe; I stuck to my known medium, pen and paper. After coming up with some concepts on paper, I was ready to play around with the program and attempted to turn my idea into art.</p>
<p>I am satisfied with my logo design, I think I applied the elements of design in a way that was cohesive and creative. My biggest critique of my work is that I got too attached to my lighthouse design and lost sight of incorporating elements of the planetarium. I worry that the logo is not immediately recognizable as advertising the planetarium, but the same could be said of multiple of the designs I saw during the critique. I didn’t realize this assignment was due until after the discussion board had closed, so unfortunately, I do not have my critiques on hand. They were generally positive; classmates mentioned that the thought behind my design was evident and I was successful in the execution. They said it looked professional and that the planetary elements I included did suggest the planetarium, but it wasn't the focal point of the design. I’m happy with the choices I made, especially the inclusion of the constellation Ursa Major in the Celestial sphere. I learned about the technical aspects of Adobe, gained a lot of confidence in building and combining shapes, and understood basic tools and how to create color groupings. For future assignments, I want to give myself time to explore multiple options and develop multiple ideas, so I have a choice in what worked best and ensure I am turning in my best work.
