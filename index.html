<p style="background-color:aquamarine;"> Hi Janna! My image won't upload even though it is formatted correctly and my link does not seem to be working - i'm sorry about this I had to give up so I could turn something in, but I hope to figure it out soon.

<h1> Project 1 Vector Graphics</h1>
  <p>I started by thinking about what represented Portland to me and what I associated with the subject of the design(planetarium). Planetarium, to me, represents outer space, and I knew I wanted to have a multifaceted design to reflect branding for the planetarium while maintaining a reference to its location, portland. I also had to come up with the type of image I knew I wanted to create. Initial drafts looked childish and rough. I didn't like the effect of drawing my shapes freehand, so I figured out I needed to combine and edit the ones that were provided through the program. I knew I wanted something readable, and I liked the idea of negative space creating the illusion of a suggested object, in this case, the lighthouse. I did not go directly to Adobe; I stuck to my known medium, pen and paper. After coming up with some concepts on paper, I was ready to play around with the program and attempted to turn my idea into art.</p>
<p>I am satisfied with my logo design, I think I applied the elements of design in a way that was cohesive and creative. My biggest critique of my work is that I got too attached to my lighthouse design and lost sight of incorporating elements of the planetarium. I worry that the logo is not immediately recognizable as advertising the planetarium, but the same could be said of multiple of the designs I saw during the critique. I didn’t realize this assignment was due until after the discussion board had closed, so unfortunately, I do not have my critiques on hand. They were generally positive; classmates mentioned that the thought behind my design was evident and I was successful in the execution. They said it looked professional and that the planetary elements I included did suggest the planetarium, but it wasn't the focal point of the design. I’m happy with the choices I made, especially the inclusion of the constellation Ursa Major in the Celestial sphere. I learned about the technical aspects of Adobe, gained a lot of confidence in building and combining shapes, and understood basic tools and how to create color groupings. For future assignments, I want to give myself time to explore multiple options and develop multiple ideas, so I have a choice in what worked best and ensure I am turning in my best work.
